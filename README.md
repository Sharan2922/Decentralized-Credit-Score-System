🏦 Decentralized Credit Score System (Work In Progress) — A blockchain + AI powered platform to bring transparency and fairness into credit scoring. Unlike traditional systems (like CIBIL in India), this system stores credit events (loan, EMI, repayments, defaults) on-chain for immutability, while AI analyzes repayment patterns to provide clear risk classifications. Users can see why their score increased or decreased, ensuring trust and accountability.
